## 📖 Overview

This repository acts as a comprehensive archive of my coursework and assignments for the **Frontend Development Class**.

It documents my weekly progress, starting from the fundamentals of web structure to building interactive user interfaces. Each folder corresponds to a specific session ("Pertemuan") and contains the exercises or projects completed during that time.
